# Welcome to my Artworks project repository

## Short summary

we had a team project with other 2 students where we had to create a so called art gallery web site.
Basically we used ReactJS and MUI library combined with nodeJS and ExpressJS.

My tasks were:

- Creating the landing page with footer, header and layout
- Styling of the page except the 'Gallery' tab

## How to make the page run

You need 2 terminals.

First you need to enter 'server' folder and run `node index.js`.
Then enter 'artworks' folder and run `npm start`. If there is any problem please run also `npm install` in this directory.

You can register if you want then enter tha page. If you do not have intention you can use a test entry.
Username: asd
Password: nemasd

## Page functions

### Login

If you are already registered you can enter the page giving your username and password.
If there is an error in these data the page gives you an error message.

### Registration

If you are a new user you can register here.
If there is any problem (user name already exist, passwords entered incorrectly) then you receive an error message.
If registration is successful you can login.

### Landing page

This page loaded after login. Here you can navigate to 'Gallery' and 'Favourites' or even log out of page.


### Gallery

You can browse our arts with the following functions:

- Sorting alphabetically
- Sorting by price
- Filter by title or creator
- Add/remove favourite by clicking the 'Heart' icon

### Favourites

This section shows what are your favourite arts.
Here you can remove them from your list.

### Footer

If you close it you maybe face with a rickroll :joy:
